# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis
**OBJECTIVE**  
This analysis focuses on uncovering sales patterns and customer segmentation opportunities for Instacart, an online grocery store operating through a mobile app. Although Instacart already achieves strong sales performance, the company aims to deepen its understanding of customer behaviors and purchasing trends to inform a more targeted marketing strategy.The results highlight the busiest shopping days and hours, peak spending periods, and top-performing product categories, while also providing insights into customer segmentation by loyalty, region, age, income, and family status. The findings reveal distinct differences in purchasing behaviors, order frequency, and price preferences across various customer groups. These insights will empower Instacart’s marketing and sales teams to develop data-driven campaigns, optimize advertising schedules, and strengthen customer engagement for improved business performance.
